# ETF Transformer Model

## Project Overview
The **ETF Transformer Model** is a deep learning-based framework designed to analyze and predict Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) performance using Transformer architectures. The project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from financial datasets.

## Objectives
- Develop a Transformer-based model for ETF trend prediction.
- Utilize Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Ensure interpretability and explainability of predictions.
- Optimize model performance using various evaluation metrics.

## Features
- **Transformer Model**: Uses state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses financial data for training.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model accuracy with MSE, RMSE, and R².
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Visualizes ETF trends and model predictions.

## Power BI Integration
This project includes a Power BI dashboard for analyzing ETF performance and model predictions. The dashboard provides:
- Time-series visualizations
- Performance comparison with benchmark ETFs
- Interactive filters for deep analysis

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Darshil02/ETF-Transformer-Model.git
cd ETF-Transformer-Model
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Model Training & Evaluation
Run the model training script from the `notebooks/` directory:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```
Check the results in the output logs and Power BI dashboard.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model explainability using SHAP & LIME.
- Expand the dataset for better generalization.
- Implement real-time ETF trend monitoring.
